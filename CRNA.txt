Hey guys - I just checked out the starter code generated by the CRNA package.  That package generates an App.js file - it is expected that you export your root component from that file, rather than registering the component with AppRegistry.  So if you're following through the course, any time I show 

AppRegistry.registerComponent('auth', () => App); 

Replace it with 

export default App
